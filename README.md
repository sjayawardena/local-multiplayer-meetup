# North London Multiplayer Meet-up
Welcome! North London Multiplayer Meet-up is a site that gives gamers of all ages, skill and interest level all the information they need to attend a regular multi-player video games meet-up - giving them the opportunity to socialise as they play local multiplayer games across a range of different consoles. The idea is that it is more like how multiplayer gaming used to be - in-person! Rather than over the internet.

The site is targeted towards would-be in-person gamers who want to socialise and make friends through their interest. It will make clear the meet-up is for everyone, and by extension encourage people to bring their family or friends.

North London Multiplayer Meet-up will be useful for would-be gamers to see when and where they can attend the gaming meet-ups, the rules of the club, they types of consoles and games on offer, as well as information on how much they can expect to pay.
